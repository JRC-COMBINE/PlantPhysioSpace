\title{Detailed triticum aestivum Stress Space Based on Affymetrix Wheat Genome Array GEO Data}
\format{A matrix with genes as rows and different physiological dimensions in columns.
Gene Entrez IDs are stored in rownames and space-dimension names in colnames.}

\description{
TA_Stress_Space_Detailed spans a 28-dimension physiological space
constructed from 4 different Wheat stress-response
gene expression datasets from "Gene Expression Omnibus" (GEO).
}
\details{
Here's the list of datasets used for making this Space:
GSE11774, GSE14697, GSE30436, GSE31759

The difference between TA_Stress_Space and
TA_Stress_Space_Detailed is that in TA_Stress_Space all
stressed dimensions with the same stress type are
summarized to make a universal axis for each stress type, while in
the space of TA_Stress_Space_Detailed stress responses from different
datasets have their own dedicated dimension.
