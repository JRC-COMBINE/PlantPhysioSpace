\title{Detailed Oryza sativa StressSpace Based on Affymetrix Rice Genome Array GEO Data}
\format{A matrix with genes as rows and different physiological dimensions in columns.
Gene Entrez IDs are stored in rownames and space-dimension names in colnames.}

actual dataset series names listed in 'Details' section.)

\description{
OS_Stress_Space_Detailed spans a 30-dimension physiological space
constructed from 8 different Rice stress-response
gene expression datasets from "Gene Expression Omnibus" (GEO).
}
\details{
Here's the list of datasets used for making this Space:
GSE14403, GSE15448, GSE16108, GSE21651, GSE24048, GSE25176, GSE26280,
GSE6901

The difference between OS_Stress_Space and
OS_Stress_Space_Detailed is that in OS_Stress_Space all
stressed dimensions with the same stress type are
summarized to make a universal axis for each stress type, while in
the space of OS_Stress_Space_Detailed stress responses from different
datasets have their own dedicated dimension.
