\title{Detailed arabidopsis thaliana Stress Space Based on RNA-seq SRA Data}
\format{A matrix with genes as rows and different physiological dimensions in columns.
Gene Entrez IDs are stored in rownames and space-dimension names in colnames.}

\description{
AT_Stress_Space_RNASeq_Detailed spans a 151-dimension physiological space
constructed from 8 different Arabidopsis thaliana stress-response
gene expression datasets from "Sequence Read Archive" (SRA).
}
\details{
Here's the list of datasets used for making this Space:
PRJEB13938 (E.MTAB.4683), PRJNA232536 (GSE53641), PRJNA263595 (GSE62256),
PRJNA272425 (GSE64870), PRJNA315516, PRJNA319318 (GSE80565),
PRJNA348676 (GSE88798), PRJNA412447

The difference between AT_Stress_Space_RNASeq and
AT_Stress_Space_RNASeq_detailed is that in AT_Stress_Space_RNASeq all
stressed dimensions with the same stress type are
summarized to make a universal axis for each stress type, while in
the space of AT_Stress_Space_RNASeq_detailed stress responses from different
datasets have their own dedicated dimension.
